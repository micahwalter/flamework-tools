These are just a variety of shell scripts and tools I've written for myself to
automate the setting up of a flamework-derived project (using my own fork of the
project).

They will probably work for you but they've been written primarily for me.

They are specific to [my branch](https://github.com/straup/flamework) of Flamework, which doesn't always track 1:1 with the [exflickr](https://github.com/exflickr/flamework) branch.
 
make-project.sh
--

Fetch all the dependencies and do a bare-bones setup for a plain vanilla
Flamework project to be hosted on an actual server:

	$> ./flamework-tools/bin/make-project.sh /path/to/your/project
	
make-project-heroku.sh
--

Fetch all the dependencies and do a bare-bones setup for a plain vanilla
Flamework project to be hosted on Heroku:

	$> ./flamework-tools/bin/make-project-heroku.sh /path/to/your/project
	
setup-db.sh
--

Perform a basic MySQL setup for a Flamework project. This will create the
database and database user, including an autogenerated password, and import the
default schema files in your project.

	$> ./flamework-tools/bin/setup-db.sh /path/to/your/project database_name database_username
